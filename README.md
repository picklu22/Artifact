I need a colorful diagram with icons that shows the process of converting normal English into SQL using Gemini. Once the SQL file is generated, it should be added to GitHub. After the DBT code is committed, a CI/CD pipeline should be triggered. The pipeline should validate both the source and target data using the generated file, create a validation report, and then send that report via email.
